●	Created Web applications with UI using Vaadin Framework and business logic using Spring REST and Hibernate which played a major role in the loose coupling between UI and business logic.
●	Performance tuning was done in SQL queries by making changes in table joins and by creating a non-clustered index to a table.
●	Included a Multi-Threading Concept in Forecasting revenue recognition module in which the parallel execution of independent procedures improved the performance of the loading time of the module.
●	Used Apache POI in Excel for aggregation operations for parent level from lower-level data in a hierarchy instead of using SQL Queries to derive parent level aggregation which drastically reduced the query fetching time and customization time which in turn improved the downloading time of Excel.   
●	Experience in analysis, designing, developing MVC Pattern multi-tiered applications in the J2EE environment.
●	Provided input to work project plan, performed a technical review of applications and peer's work and developed proposals for improvements.
●	Worked with engineering managers to develop and improve coding standards, design patterns, and practices and to develop integrated features and tools.

Software Engineer                                                                                                    Jan16 - Dec 16

●	Coding of several modules related to Building blocks, Pricing and Forecasting revenue recognition in the Life Science domain in which currently available transactions and a historical record were used to forecast the total expenses that the business may incur in a fiscal year.
●	Made use of session table concept instead of using whole bulk data from the main table which in turn drastically improved the performance of the Forecasting revenue recognition module.
●	Known for excellent troubleshooting skills – able to analyze code and engineer well-researched, cost-effective and responsive solutions.
●	Developed an application (called Projection Variance)  which is used to calculate the difference and per of change for current and prior sales data and added functionality to existing applications using Java/J2EE technologies.
●	Following the Project life cycle methodology like Agile defined under the process framework, ensured customer deadlines were met within project budgets.

●	Utilized Vaadin Framework for persistence and application layers.
●	Gained extensive experience on tools like JIRA, SourceTree, creating and making use of maven projects using IDE like Eclipse and NetBeans 
●	Reduced the number of lines in Code by optimizing the customization process in an abstract way which improves more of the readability of the code.
●	Addressed day to day technical issues and unit testing were made for those issues.
●	Code changes were done in an abstract and configurable way so that in future, change in one place will be effectively altered in all other places of the modules.
